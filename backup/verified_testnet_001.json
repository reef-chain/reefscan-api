For example, if the\n/// `RedeemableERC20` token contract holds 100 000 USDC then a holder of the\n/// redeemable token can burn some of their tokens to receive a % of that USDC.\n/// If they redeemed (burned) an amount equal to 10% of the redeemable token\n/// supply then they would receive 10 000 USDC.\n///\n/// To make the treasury assets discoverable anyone can call `newTreasuryAsset`\n/// to emit an event containing the treasury asset address. As malicious and/or\n/// spam users can emit many treasury events there is a need for sensible\n/// indexing and filtering of asset events to only trusted users. This contract\n/// is agnostic to how that trust relationship is defined for each user.\n///\n/// Users must specify all the treasury assets they wish to redeem to the\n/// `redeem` function. After `redeem` is called the redeemed tokens are burned\n/// so all treasury assets must be specified and claimed in a batch atomically.\n/// Note: The same amount of `RedeemableERC20` is burned, regardless of which\n/// treasury assets were specified. Specifying fewer assets will NOT increase\n/// the proportion of each that is returned.\n///\n/// `RedeemableERC20` has several owner administrative functions:\n/// - Owner can add senders and receivers that can send/receive tokens even\n///   during `Phase.ONE`\n/// - Owner can end `Phase.ONE` during `Phase.ZERO` by specifying the address\n///   of a distributor, which will have any undistributed tokens burned.\n///\n/// The redeem functions MUST be used to redeem and burn RedeemableERC20s\n/// (NOT regular transfers).\n///\n/// `redeem` will simply revert if called outside `Phase.ONE`.\n/// A `Redeem` event is emitted on every redemption (per treasury asset) as\n/// `(redeemer, asset, redeemAmount)`.\ncontract RedeemableERC20 is\n    AccessControl,\n    Phased,\n    TierByConstruction,\n    ERC20,\n    ReentrancyGuard,\n    ERC20Burnable\n    {\n\n    using SafeERC20 for IERC20;\n\n    bytes32 public constant SENDER = keccak256(\"SENDER\");\n    bytes32 public constant RECEIVER = keccak256(\"RECEIVER\");\n    bytes32 public constant DISTRIBUTOR_BURNER =\n        keccak256(\"DISTRIBUTOR_BURNER\");\n\n    /// Redeemable token added by creator.\n    event TreasuryAsset(address indexed emitter, address indexed asset);\n\n    /// Redeemable token burn for reserve.\n    event Redeem(\n        // Account burning and receiving.\n        address indexed redeemer,\n        // The treasury asset being sent to the burner.\n        address indexed treasuryAsset,\n        // The amounts of the redeemable and treasury asset as\n        // `[redeemAmount, assetAmount]`\n        uint256[2] redeemAmounts\n    );\n\n    /// RedeemableERC20 uses the standard/default 18 ERC20 decimals.\n    /// The minimum supply enforced by the constructor is \"one\" token which is\n    /// `10 ** 18`.\n    /// The minimum supply does not prevent subsequent redemption/burning.\n    uint256 public constant MINIMUM_INITIAL_SUPPLY = 10 ** 18;\n\n    /// The minimum status that a user must hold to receive transfers during\n    /// `Phase.ZERO`.\n    /// The tier contract passed to `TierByConstruction` determines if\n    /// the status is held during `_beforeTokenTransfer`.\n    /// Not immutable because it is read during the constructor by the `_mint`\n    /// call.\n    ITier.Tier public minimumTier;\n\n    /// Mint the full ERC20 token supply and configure basic transfer\n    /// restrictions.\n    /// @param config_ Constructor configuration.\n    constructor (\n        RedeemableERC20Config memory config_\n    )\n        ERC20(config_.erc20Config.name, config_.erc20Config.symbol)\n        TierByConstruction(config_.tier)\n    {\n        require(\n            config_.totalSupply >= MINIMUM_INITIAL_SUPPLY,\n            \"MINIMUM_INITIAL_SUPPLY\"\n        );\n        minimumTier = config_.minimumStatus;\n\n        _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, config_.admin);\n        _setupRole(RECEIVER, config_.admin);\n        // Minting and burning must never fail.\n        _setupRole(SENDER, address(0));\n        _setupRole(RECEIVER, address(0));\n\n        _mint(config_.admin, config_.totalSupply);\n    }\n\n    /// The admin can burn all tokens of a single address to end `Phase.ZERO`.\n    /// The intent is that during `Phase.ZERO` there is some contract\n    /// responsible for distributing the tokens.\n    /// The admin specifies the distributor to end `Phase.ZERO` and all\n    /// undistributed tokens are burned.\n    /// The distributor is NOT set during the constructor because it likely\n    /// doesn't exist at that point.
