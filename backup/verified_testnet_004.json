The way this is specified is by assigning each\n * account to a number of shares. Of all the REEF that this contract receives, each account will then be able to claim\n * an amount proportional to the percentage of total shares they were assigned.\n *\n * `Splitz` follows a _pull payment_ model. This means that payments are not automatically forwarded to the\n * accounts but kept in this contract, and the actual transfer is triggered as a separate step by calling the {release}\n * function.\n *\n * NOTE: This contract assumes that ERC20 tokens will behave similarly to native tokens (Ether). Rebasing tokens, and\n * tokens that apply fees during transfers, are likely to not be supported as expected. If in doubt, we encourage you\n * to run tests before sending real value to this contract.\n */\ncontract Splitz {\n    event PaymentReleased(address indexed to, uint256 amount);\n    event PaymentReceived(address indexed from, uint256 amount);\n    event ERC20PaymentReleased(IERC20 indexed token, address indexed to, uint256 amount);\n\n    struct PayeeShare {\n        address payee;\n        uint256 share;\n    }\n\n    uint256 public totalShares;\n    uint256 private totalReleased;\n    mapping(address => uint256) public shares;\n    mapping(address => uint256) public released;\n    address[] private payees;\n    mapping(IERC20 => uint256) public totalReleasedERC20;\n    mapping(IERC20 => mapping(address => uint256)) public releasedERC20;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Creates an instance of `Splitz` where each account in `_payees` is assigned the number of shares at\n     * the matching position in the `_shares` array.\n     *\n     * All addresses in `_payees` must be non-zero.
