This behavior is nonetheless\n * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20\n * applications.\n *\n * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.\n * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just\n * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit\n * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.\n *\n * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}\n * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting\n * allowances.

This behavior is nonetheless\n * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20\n * applications.\n *\n * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.\n * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just\n * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit\n * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.\n *\n * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}\n * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting\n * allowances.

This behavior is nonetheless\n * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20\n * applications.\n *\n * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.\n * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just\n * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit\n * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.\n *\n * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}\n * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting\n * allowances.
